# Comparative Analysis of Recommendation Algorithms

A systematic evaluation of recommendation approaches using the Amazon Electronics dataset, comparing collaborative filtering, content-based, and hybrid recommendation strategies.

## Research Overview

This project examines the relative effectiveness of different recommendation paradigms:

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Matrix factorization using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify latent factors in user-product interactions
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: TF-IDF vectorization of product reviews with cosine similarity to find similar products
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Weighted ensemble combining both methods for comprehensive recommendation generation

## Experimental Results

Our comparative analysis demonstrates performance differences across recommendation strategies:

| Model | Precision@10 | Recall@10 |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Collaborative Filtering | 0.068 | 0.075 |
| Content-Based | 0.042 | 0.051 |
| **Hybrid** | **0.085** | **0.092** |

The hybrid approach shows a 25% improvement in precision and a 23% improvement in recall over the collaborative filtering baseline.

## Methodology

The experimental framework follows these steps:
- Data preprocessing with handling for sparse user-item matrices
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF for textual content
- Matrix factorization with adaptive dimensionality based on matrix constraints
- Systematic evaluation using precision@k and recall@k metrics
- Cross-validation to ensure result reliability

## Technical Implementation

- **Data Pipeline**: Preprocessing for handling textual reviews and user-item interactions
- **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF vectorization with optimized parameters
- **Model Architecture**: SVD-based matrix factorization with automatic parameter selection
- **Evaluation Framework**: Comprehensive metrics implementation for recommendation quality assessment

## Technologies Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- SciPy for matrix operations and SVD implementation 
- Matplotlib for visualization
- Potential deployment with Flask API
